# Splendor Project Method Code

All the team members tried to use several methods, and we put all techniques here.

* **Jiehuang Shi:** The method used by Jiehuang is Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) - Value Iteration and several policy-based methods. The final myTeam.py is also based on the Value Iteration algorithm.
* **Mo Zhou:** Mo Zhou implemented the low score version of MDPs algorithm, which is the second technique our group uses.
* **Boyang Zhang:** Boyang implements the Astar and q-learning algorithms.
